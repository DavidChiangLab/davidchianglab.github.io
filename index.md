## From gene discovery to drug discovery for cardiac arrhythmias

The Chiang Lab investigates the genetic and molecular mechanisms that govern the heart's electrical system, with a focus on how _SCN5A_ loss-of-function and related pathways lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. We integrate CRISPR-based functional genomics, zebrafish models, hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, and AI-enabled phenotyping to uncover disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets. By bridging fundamental discovery with translational science, we aim to develop novel gene-based and pharmacologic therapies that restore cardiac conduction and prevent sudden cardiac death. Our mission is to transform care for patients and families suffering from life-threatening arrhythmias in both rare genetic and common heart diseases.

## Prospective Trainees

We are a collaborative and curiosity-driven lab dedicated to understanding and treating inherited cardiac arrhythmias at their source. Trainees in the Chiang Lab gain hands-on experience across genome engineering, electrophysiology, zebrafish genetics, stem cell biology, drug discovery, and computational/AI approaches. We value rigorous science, mentorship, and creativity—and we aim to train the next generation of physician-scientists and researchers who will shape the future of cardiac precision medicine.

## Philanthropy, Donors, and Partners
Sudden cardiac death remains one of the most devastating and unexpected causes of loss in young people and families. The Chiang Lab is committed to changing that reality by identifying the root causes of electrical disease and developing targeted therapies that can prevent lethal arrhythmias before they strike. Our work integrates cutting-edge genetic models, high-throughput screening platforms, and translational therapeutics to accelerate breakthroughs from bench to bedside. Philanthropic support fuels high-risk, high-reward research that is not yet funded by traditional grants—and helps us move lifesaving discoveries to patients faster.
