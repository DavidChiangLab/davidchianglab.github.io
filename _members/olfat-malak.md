Olfat is an electrophysiologist by training. She grew up in Lebanon and earned her
bachelor’s degree in biology from the Lebanese University in Beirut. She then moved
to France, where she completed a master’s degree in biology, biotechnology and
therapeutic research at the University of Nantes and the Institut du Thorax.

After receiving the Line Pomaret Delalande Prize from the Medical Research
Foundation, Olfat pursued her PhD studies within the Ion Channels and
Cardiopathies team at the Institut du Thorax. Her research focused on elucidating
the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac, neuronal and muscular
channelopathies using peptides that mimic specific regions of ion channels.

Olfat later received a Visiting Junior Scholar Fellowship from the France-Stanford
Center for Interdisciplinary Studies and joined Dr. Joseph Wu’s lab at Stanford
University. There, she modeled cardiac arrhythmia diseases using patient-specific
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). During that time,
she developed a strong interest in how the autonomic nervous system regulates
cardiac function, which led her to the Buck Institute for Research on Aging for
postdoctoral training.

At the Buck Institute, Olfat was awarded two postdoctoral fellowships: one from the
National Institute of Health (NIH, T32) and another from the Global Consortium for
Reproductive Longevity & Equality (GCRLE). Her postdoctoral work focused on
understanding how synaptic transmission influences organ and tissue function
during aging.

Olfat joined the Chiang Lab with over a decade of multidisciplinary research
experience. She investigates the molecular mechanisms of inherited cardiac
arrhythmias using human iPSC-CMs and zebrafish models, combining state-of-the-
art electrophysiology and microscopy techniques. Her main goal is to develop new
and personalized therapeutics for these diseases.

When she is not in the lab, Olfat enjoys working out, connecting with nature, reading,
exploring new cultures through travel, and occasionally ballroom dancing.
