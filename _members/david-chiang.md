David grew up in Taiwan and moved to Vancouver, Canada at the age of 11. He obtained his B.Sc. in Honours Physiology from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, and his MD and PhD from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. After a short research fellowship in Utrecht University, The Netherlands, David moved to Boston, MA with his growing family for his residency training in Internal Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and research training in the lab of Dr. Calum MacRae. During this time, David also received training in Precision & Genomic Medicine from the Center of Genomic Medicine at Mass General Hospital. Afterwards, David completed another residency in Clinical Genetics at Harvard Medical School and further research training with Dr. MacRae. David started his independent research program in the Fall of 2024 and also sees patients with suspected or confirmed genetics disorders in clinic at BWH. When he's not in the lab or at the hospital, David enjoys exploring New England with his children.
